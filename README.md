# Visual Comparison Browser

The Visual Comparison (VC) browser supports the visual comparison of datasets, particularly wide datasets. The application consists of three stacked views with each view showing a progressively more detailed look at the dataset. Users can use various forms of interaction such as clicking an element of interest, sliding a slider to select a region of an element, or selecting filters in a drop-down menu to filter their dataset.

The VC browser is freely available to use at [https://genomevis.usask.ca/visual-comparison-browser/](https://genomevis.usask.ca/visual-comparison-browser/)
